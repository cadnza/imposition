# Bookbinding for R

![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cadnza/imposition) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/r-package/v/cadnza/imposition)

An R package that takes care of the tedious calculations involved with the imposition process in bookbinding.

(Bookbinding is hard, and it's *really* hard when you have lots of pages. This packages makes it easier.)

## Why is it written in R?

The short answer is because I need it for a project.

## Installation

R console:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cadnza/imposition")
```

## Use

Here's the R `man` page:

```
?imposition
```
